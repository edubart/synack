ABOUT
  Tool created for testing DDOS/DOS attacks. Supports SYN, UDP, TCP connection,
  ACK, PUSH+ACK and mixed floods. Created FOR EDUCATIONAL AND TESTING purposes
  only.

    $ make
    $ sudo make install

FLOODS DESCRIPTION
  TCP Ping
    Ping a TCP port by seding simple SYN packet, option created
    just to see the target responsiveness.

  Connection flood
    Flood TCP services with the 3-way TCP handshake causing
    massive amount of connections on the host, exhausting it's resources
    and then preventing new connections.

    NOTE: If you use this attack, you MUST add the following iptables
    rule to prevent your kernel saboting the attack, otherwise your
    kernel will reject all established connections on the target:
      iptables -I OUTPUT -p tcp --tcp-flags ALL RST -j DROP

    NOTE: Spoofing can't be used with this attack.

    NOTE: If you are behind a shared connection with a router as gateway,
    make sure that the router can handle massive amount of connections,
    usually home user routers can't, so you might wan't to connect directly
    if possible. By directly I mean assigning your public IP directly to
    your interface.

  SYN, UDP floods
    Well known flood types

  ACK, PA, Mixed S/A/PA/FA and Mixed A/PA/FA floods
    Uncommon flood types created for testing purposes

    NOTE:
      PA = TCP with flags PUSH+ACK set
      FA = TCP with flags FIN+ACK set
      S = TCP with flag SYN set
      A = TCP with flag ACK set


  NOTE: All flood statistics are read from the interface TX, so synack
  doesn't report really only the flood traffic, instead it reports
  all your interface output traffic.

USAGE
  synack -i <interface> -h <host> [action] [options]
  Actions:
      -P                - TCP ping (default action)
      -C                - Connection flood
      -S                - SYN flood
      -A                - ACK flood
      -D                - PA flood
      -M                - Mixed S/A/PA/FA flood
      -N                - Mixed A/PA/FA flood
      -U                - UDP flood
  General options:
      -i [interface]    - Which interface to do the action (required)
      -h [host]         - Target host (required)
      -p [port]         - Target port (default: random)
      -t [time]         - Run time in seconds (default: infinite)
      -u [interval]     - Sleep interval in microseconds (default: 10000)
      -b [bytes]        - Additional random bytes to send as data (default: 0)
      -m [threads]      - Number of send threads (default: 1)
      -s [ip]           - Custom source ip, you may set to 'random' (default: interface ip)
      -d [binary file]  - Send binary file as data
      -f [text file]    - Read a list of IPs from a text file for spoofing
      -o                - Enable tcp options on SYN packets
      -q                - Quiet, don't print statistics output
      -x                - Drop established connections when receive ACK packets
      -y [delay]        - Drop established connections after delay
      --help            - Print this help
